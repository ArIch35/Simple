### PhotoTracker
A Project where user can send photos via Web Pages and then save some Information about that photo (title,desc). User can also see the photos that already been uploaded in the "Home" page. The images are saved locally (if you want to change the path, change the "PATH_ROOT_FOLDER" in ".../backend/absoluteLocationPath.js") and the meta info that are needed for image reconstruction and other info are saved in a local database that uses MySQL and XAMPP to run (if you want to change database/use database, change ".../backend/database.js"). User can also add the images to Favourites and they can see them there.
